# SupaBaseProject

- What I Learned
How to set up a Supabase project from scratch

Enabling and using authentication

Creating tables and adding RLS policies

Writing and deploying Edge Functions using the Supabase 

Using the Supabase client with server-side auth (via JWT) "Token"

connecting SupaBase with client (PostMan)

- Challenges I Faced

Learn what is SupaBase 
  
Understanding how RLS policies work and how to test them on PostMan

Figuring out how to pass the JWT token to Edge Functions

Handling authorization errors clearly in the API

Getting familiar with TypeScript/Deno environment for Edge Functions

- What Iâ€™d Do Differently Next Time
Set up a better folder structure from the start (for code organization)

Add unit tests for my Edge Functions

Use Supabase's local dev environment more for faster testing like "installing docker to be the container"

Explore database migrations instead of manually creating tables via the UI
